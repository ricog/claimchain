# ClaimChain - crowd audited claims

Decentralized, open source, crowd sourced model for sharing the cost of life's unexpected expenses.

## Preliminary Concepts

- Policy types and coverage types can be unlimited. There can be policies that cover everything.
- Members make payments into the system and file claims into the system.
- Trust is in math using a distributed ledger like Bitcoin. It can run on Bitcoin or a similar network.
- Payments are secured automatically by the blockchain and multi-signature wallets.
- Claims are audited by members, chosen semi-randomly using a open source algorithm.
- A concensus is needed for the system to release claim payouts.
- Fully automated. There is no central authority; no insurance agencies.

## Possible Issues

- A greedy member could profit from making excessive claims.
- Many greedy members could coordinate to bankrupt the system.
 
## Other Notes

The original name I came up with was CrowdClaim. Another was CrowdSure. These are in use.

# ClaimChain - crowd audited claims

Decentralized, open source, crowd sourced model for sharing the cost of life's unexpected expenses.

## Why

Unexpected expenses happen, it's a fact of life. Insurance provides a financial safety net for those expenses, reducing the impact on your standard of living. Insurance organizations make it possible to organize the funds and verify claims. This administration is costly to the entities being insured. Administration overhead can account for as much as 30% of the actual expenses.

## Preliminary Concepts

- Policy types and coverage types can be unlimited. There can be policies that cover everything.
- Members make payments into the system and file claims into the system.
- Trust is in math using a distributed ledger like Bitcoin. It can run on Bitcoin or a similar network.
- Payments are secured automatically by the blockchain and multi-signature wallets.
- Unprovable claims are audited by members, chosen semi-randomly using a open source algorithm.
- A concensus is needed for the system to release claim payouts.
- Decentralized. There is no central authority; no insurance agencies.

## Process

1. Make an initial payment, providing proof of existance, and other information.
2. Make periodic payments as requested to maintain insured status.
3. Unexpected event occurs.
4. Send claim to system with designated payment recipients.
5. System performs preliminary automated verification.
6. System instantly pays out an approved portion of the funds.
6. Human auditors are randomly selected, if needed.
7. Remaining funds are paid out.

## Creating Policies

Policies can be created with almost any criteria and payout mechanics. Users meeting the criteria send proof into the system to become registered. As smart contract capabilities evolve, they will be able to enforce policy rules. If a claim can't be automatically verified, manual auditing by semi-randomly selected users can occur.

## Possible Issues

### A greedy member could profit from making excessive claims

Relying on a system of proof can mitigate this.

### Many greedy members could coordinate to bankrupt the system

Using a system of proof and semi-random auditors, this could become extremely difficult.

## Other Notes

The original name I came up with was CrowdClaim. Another was CrowdSure. These are in use.
